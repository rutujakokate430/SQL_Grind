Stratascratch: Hard - Product Families (ID 2123)

The CMO is interested in understanding how the sales of different product families are affected by promotional campaigns. To do so, for each product family, show the total number of units sold, as well as the percentage of units sold that had a valid promotion among total units sold. If there are NULLS in the result, replace them with zeroes. Promotion is valid if it's not empty and it's contained inside promotions table.

SELECT fp.product_family, 
IFNULL(SUM(fs.units_sold), 0) AS total_units_sold, ifnull(sum(case when fsp.promotion_id is not null then fs.units_sold end),0) as sold_on_promo,
ifnull(ifnull(sum(case when fsp.promotion_id is not null then fs.units_sold end),0)/IFNULL(SUM(fs.units_sold), 0),0) as per_units_sold_promo
FROM facebook_products fp
LEFT JOIN facebook_sales fs ON fs.product_id = fp.product_id
LEFT JOIN facebook_sales_promotions fsp on fsp.promotion_id= fs.promotion_id
GROUP BY fp.product_family
