Stratascratch: Host Popularity Rental Prices (Medium)

You are given a table named airbnb_host_searches that contains data for rental property searches made by users. Determine the minimum, average, and maximum rental prices for each popularity-rating bucket. A popularity-rating bucket should be assigned to every record based on its number_of_reviews (see rules below).


The host’s popularity rating is defined as below:
•   0 reviews: "New"
•   1 to 5 reviews: "Rising"
•   6 to 15 reviews: "Trending Up"
•   16 to 40 reviews: "Popular"
•   More than 40 reviews: "Hot"


Tip: The id column in the table refers to the search ID.


Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum rental prices. Order the solution by the minimum price.
