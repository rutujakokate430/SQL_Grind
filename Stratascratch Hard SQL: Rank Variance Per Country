## My query Solution:

with dec as(
select fa.country, sum(fc.number_of_comments) AS comment_count, DENSE_RANK() OVER(order by SUM(fc.number_of_comments) desc) as rnk_dec from fb_comments_count fc
RIGHT JOIN fb_active_users fa on fa.user_id= fc.user_id
where fc.created_at BETWEEN '2019-12-01' and '2019-12-31'
GROUP BY fa.country
), 
jan as(
select fa.country, sum(fc.number_of_comments) AS comment_count, DENSE_RANK() OVER(order by SUM(fc.number_of_comments) desc) as rnk_jan from fb_comments_count fc
RIGHT JOIN fb_active_users fa on fa.user_id= fc.user_id
where fc.created_at BETWEEN '2020-01-01' and '2020-01-31'
GROUP BY fa.country

SELECT j.country AS Country FROM jan j
JOIN dec d ON j.country= d.country
Where rnk_jan>rnk_dec
