Using it, calculate the total time that each post was viewed by users. Output post ID and the total viewing time in seconds, but only for posts with a total viewing time of over 5 seconds.

## Solution:

SELECT post_id, SUM(duration*(perc_viewed/100))::FLOAT as viewing_time from post_views p
JOIN (
select session_id,EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM session_endtime)- (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM session_starttime) ) as duration from user_sessions ) a on a.session_id= p.session_id
group by post_id
having SUM(duration*(perc_viewed/100))::FLOAT>5


 post_id	viewing_time
4	5.1
2	24
