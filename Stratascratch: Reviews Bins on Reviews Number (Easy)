Stratascratch: Reviews Bins on Reviews Number (Easy)

To better understand how the number of reviews affects accommodation prices, classify each listing based on its number of reviews (use column number_of_reviews) into the following categories:


•  0 reviews: "NO"
•  1 to 5 reviews: "FEW"
•  6 to 15 reviews: "SOME"
•  16 to 40 reviews: "MANY"
•  More than 40 reviews: "A LOT"


For each record, output the price along with the corresponding category that describes its review count.

select *,
case when number_of_reviews=0 then  "NO"
    when number_of_reviews>=1 and number_of_reviews<=5 then "FEW"
    when number_of_reviews>=6 and number_of_reviews<=15 then "SOME"
    when number_of_reviews>=16 and number_of_reviews<=40 then "MANY"
    when number_of_reviews>40 then "A LOT"
END as price_category
