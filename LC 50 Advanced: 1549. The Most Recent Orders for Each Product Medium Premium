Write a solution to find the most recent order(s) of each product.

The result format is in the following example.

+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |

Explanation: 
keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we do not include it in the result table.

## Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
with max_order_date as (
SELECT p.product_name, p.product_id, MAX(o.order_date) AS max_order
from Orders o
join Customers c on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
JOIN Products p on p.product_id= o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id
)

select m.product_name, m.product_id, o.order_id, o.order_date from max_order_date m
JOIN Orders o on o.product_id= m.product_id
where o.order_date = m.max_order
order by m.product_name, m.product_id, o.order_id, order_date asc
