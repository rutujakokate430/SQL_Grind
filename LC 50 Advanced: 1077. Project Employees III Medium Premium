Explanation: Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.

## Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH rnked as (
select p.project_id, e.employee_id, rank() over(partition by p.project_id order by e.experience_years desc) as rnk from Project p
left JOIN Employee e on e.employee_id= p.employee_id
)

select project_id, employee_id from rnked
where rnk=1
